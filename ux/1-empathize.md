## Research Methodology Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: These are Assumption-Based Proto-Personas**

**Persona Development Approach:**
These personas were created **without actual user research** and are based on:
- Typical customer segment patterns observed in urban cafés/restaurants
- General assumptions about behavior based on demographic archetypes
- Logical inferences about technology comfort and visit patterns
- Common pain points reported in loyalty program literature

**Customer Segments Assumed:**
- Commuters (high frequency, low dwell time, tech-savvy)
- Students (high frequency, high dwell time, budget-conscious)
- Social diners (moderate frequency, high spend per visit)
- Irregular visitors (low frequency, varied behavior)
- Retired regulars (very high frequency, community-focused, low-tech)

**Critical Limitations:**
- ❌ **No actual user interviews conducted** - Personas are hypothetical
- ❌ **No observational research** - Behaviors are assumed, not observed
- ❌ **No data validation** - Visit patterns, spending, and pain points are guesses
- ❌ **No staff input** - Frontline insights are missing
- ❌ **No surveys or analytics** - No quantitative validation
- ⚠️ May not capture all customer segments at Brews N' Bites
- ⚠️ Cultural and regional variations not considered
- ⚠️ Accessibility needs require deeper exploration
- ⚠️ Risk of bias and stereotyping without real data

**Assumptions That MUST Be Validated:**

1. **Customer Segments:**
   - Do these 5 segments actually exist at Brews N' Bites?
   - Are there other important segments we're missing?
   - What's the distribution of customers across these segments?

2. **Technology Comfort:**
   - How many customers actually lack smartphones?
   - What's the actual tech comfort level across age groups?
   - Do younger customers really prefer digital solutions?

3. **Pain Points:**
   - How often do customers actually lose stamp cards?
   - Do high-spenders really feel undervalued?
   - Is transparency into progress actually important to customers?
   - Do irregular visitors feel excluded?

4. **Behaviors:**
   - What are actual visit frequency patterns?
   - What's the average transaction value by customer type?
   - How often do customers forget to use their stamp card?
   - Do staff consistently remember to stamp cards?

5. **Motivations:**
   - Why do customers actually visit Brews N' Bites?
   - How important are rewards vs. quality, atmosphere, convenience?
   - Would a new system actually change behavior?

6. **Current System Performance:**
   - What's the actual redemption rate of stamp cards?
   - How many cards are in circulation?
   - What percentage of customers participate?
   - How satisfied are customers with the current system?

**Validation Plan:**

Once we have a prototype, we must conduct real research:

**Phase 1: Discovery Research**
- [ ] Interview 10-15 actual Brews N' Bites customers (mix of frequencies)
- [ ] Observe customer behavior during 10+ hours across different times
- [ ] Interview staff (baristas, servers, managers) about customer patterns
- [ ] Analyze any existing data (POS reports, card usage, etc.)
- [ ] Survey broader customer base (50+ responses)

**Phase 2: Validate Personas**
- [ ] Compare real findings to assumed personas
- [ ] Adjust or create new personas based on actual data
- [ ] Identify which pain points are real vs. assumed
- [ ] Validate technology preferences and capabilities

**Phase 3: Prototype Testing**
- [ ] Test prototype with representatives from each validated segment
- [ ] Observe actual usage patterns and difficulties
- [ ] Gather feedback on proposed solution
- [ ] Iterate based on real user input

**Research Questions to Answer:**
1. Who are Brews N' Bites' actual customers? (demographics, psychographics)
2. What are their real visit patterns and spending habits?
3. What do they actually think about the current stamp card system?
4. What problems do they actually experience?
5. What would motivate them to participate in a loyalty program?
6. What are their technology capabilities and preferences?
7. What are their expectations for rewards?

**Next Steps:**
This assumption-based design exercise will help us:
- Create a concrete prototype to test with real users
- Identify specific questions to ask during research
- Generate hypotheses to validate or disprove
- Practice design thinking methodology

**However:** All design decisions must be validated with actual Brews N' Bites customers before final implementation.
